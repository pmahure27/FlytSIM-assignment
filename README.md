# FlytSIM-assignment
 Build a demo app (using C++/Python FlytAPIs) to make the drone takeoff at 5m, move in a square trajectory of side length 6.5m at height 5m and land once the entire mission is over. Demonstrate the app and fly the drone in the FlytSIM simulator.

# Run these programs:
- place these files in /flyt/flytos/onboard/install/ directory.
- for python : run using python drone.py
- for c++ : compile using g++ assignment.cpp -o assignment
- then run using /flyt/flytos/onboard/install/assignment

# requisites.
